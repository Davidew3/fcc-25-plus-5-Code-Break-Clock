# FCC 25 + 5 Clock

## Description

This is a React 17 application built with Bootstrap. A 25 + 5 Clock is a nice tool for coding. Adjust the break length and the session length and hit the start button. The app is good for me becuase when I get going in a project, I will often lose track of time and forget to stretch, eat, and/or anything else that distracts me from my current project. Setting the session to 25 minutes and the break to 5 minutes will have you taking a 5 minute break every 25 minutes of coding. Once you hit start, it will run until you click the reset button. There is an alarm that will go off when the session and break times expire. This project was a nice challenge and fun to complete. All the details of what is needed can be found in the package.json.
